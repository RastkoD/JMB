            Basquiat was born on December 22, 1960, Brooklyn, New York City.
            Jean's mother instilled a love for art in her young son by taking
            him to local art museums and enrolling him as a junior member of the
            Brooklyn Museum of Art. Basquiat was a precocious child who learned
            to read and write by the age of four. His mother encouraged her
            son's artistic talent and he often tried to draw his favorite
            cartoons. After his parents separated his mother was committed to a
            psychiatric hospital when he was ten and thereafter spent her life
            in and out of institutions.

          <p>
            At the age of eight, Basquiat was struck by a car. While in the
            hospital recovering from surgery, his mother brought him the book
            "Gray's Anatomy". Basquiat was moved by the book that it'd later
            serve inspiration for his artwork.

            In the 70s, Jean-Michel and friend Al Diaz began spray-painting
            graffiti on buildings in Lower Manhattan area under the pseudonym
            “SAMO.” Basquiat's early art wasn't actual images, but peculiar
            messages of a non-religious and non-political nature. Basquiat and
            Diaz combated social issues. The era of “SAMO” ended when Diaz and
            Basquiat split and went their separate ways. As the two fell apart,
            Basquiat altered the art by stating "SAMO IS DEAD."

              After seeing the exhibition, the Italian gallerist Emilio Mazzoli
              invited Basquiat to Modena for his first solo show in 1981. In the
              same year, Artforum published an article about Basquait entitled
              “The Radiant Child”.

          Basquiat sold his first painting, Cadillac Moon (1981), to Debbie
          Harry, lead singer of the punk rock band Blondie. At the time,
          Basquiat was living with his girlfriend, who financially supported
          him.In September 1981, art dealer Annina Nosei invited Basquiat to
          join her gallery. Soon after, he participated in her group show Public
          Address. She provided him with materials and a space to work in the
          basement of her gallery. He had his first American one-man show at the
          Annina Nosei Gallery in March 1982. He also painted in Modena for his
          second Italian exhibition in March 1982. Feeling exploited, that show
          was canceled because he was expected to make eight paintings in one
          week. By the summer of 1982, Basquiat had left the Annina Nosei
          Gallery and gallerist Bruno Bischofberger became his worldwide art
          dealer. In June 1982, at 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to
          ever take part in documenta in Kassel, Germany. His works were
          exhibited alongside Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, Cy
          Twombly and Andy Warhol.

              Bischofberger gave Basquiat a one-man show at his Zurich gallery
              in September 1982, and arranged for him to meet Warhol for lunch
              on October 4, 1982. Warhol recalled, "I took a Polaroid and he
              went home and within two hours a painting was back, still wet, of
              him and me together." The painting, Dos Cabezas (1982), ignited a
              friendship between them. The pair collaborated on works between
              1983 and 1985,

              with Warhol helping to boost Basquiat into the art “establishment”
              of the time, and Basquiat helping to rejuvenate Warhol’s image. In
              November 1982, Basquiat's solo exhibition opened at the Fun
              Gallery in the East Village. Among the works exhibited were A
              Panel of Experts (1982) and Equals Pi (1982). Later that month,
              Basquiat began working at the studio space art dealer Larry
              Gagosian had built.

            Following his exhibition in New York in April 1988, Basquiat
            traveled to Maui in June to withdraw from drug use.

          <p>
            After returning to New York in July, Basquiat ran into Keith Haring
            on Broadway, who stated that this last encounter was the only time
            Basquiat ever discussed his drug problem with him. Glenn O'Brien
            also recalled Basquiat calling him and telling him he was "feeling
            really good."
          </p>
          <p>
            As he was lead more into addiction, he sought out help, but
            unfortunately it was to late. Basquiat died at the age of 27 of a
            heroin overdose at his home on Great Jones Street in Manhattan on
            August 12, 1988. Basquiat is buried at Brooklyn's Green-Wood
            Cemetery. A private funeral was on August 17, 1988.

            Basquiat's former girlfriend Suzanne recited sections of A. R.
            Penck's "Poem for Basquiat". In memory of the late artist, Keith
            Haring created the painting "A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel
            Basquiat". In the obituary Haring wrote for Vogue, he stated: "He
            truly created a lifetime of works in ten years. Greedily, we wonder
            what else he might have created, what masterpieces we have been
            cheated out of by his death, but the fact is that he has created
            enough work to intrigue generations to come. Only now will people
            begin to understand the magnitude of his contribution"
